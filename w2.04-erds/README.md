# Database Design

Today we are discussing Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and the fundamental principles of database design. In this session, we will explore the basics of Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), MySQL data types, principles of database design, normalization, and the various types of relationships commonly found in database systems.

## MySQL
The database we will be using for this stack is MySQL, a relational database system. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data.

## Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities within a database and the relationships between them.

For those of you on Windows and Macs running Ventura or earlier, we will be using MySQL Workbench to design our databases and create ERDs.

For Macs running Sonoma (the latest MacOS), we will be using a VS Code extension called [ERD Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dineug.vuerd-vscode).

**Components of ERDs:**
- Entities
- Attributes
- Relationships

Entities: Represent real-world objects such as people, places, or things.

Attributes: Characteristics or properties of entities.
Relationships: Connections between entities, depicting how they interact or associate with each other.
Notation: Crowâ€™s Foot notation or Chen notation are commonly used to represent ERDs.
