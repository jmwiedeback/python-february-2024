"""
Create a classes package. It should contain two
modules - vinyl_record and collector.

in collector, create a `Collector` class. The
constructor should accept a dictionary as input.

The class will have the following properties:
    - name
    - collection

The collection attribute's value will initially be
an empty list.

In vinyl_record, paste the `VinylRecord` class.
add a new attribute to the class - `owner`. Its
value will initially be `None`.

Back in the collector module, add a new instance
method - `add_record`. This method adds a `VinylRecord`
object to the `Collector` instance's `collection`
attribute and assigns the `Collector` instance to
the `VinylRecord` instance's `owner` attribute.

Test your code here in app.py.
